==================
Rooting the device
==================

In a gist, ``rooting`` an android devices is like gaining a root
access. This also means now the user can have write access to any part
of file system. Some android phone need special apk's to get it
rooted, some don't. Some device can be rooted just by editing one or
more file(s). 


for new device with ``ics``
===========================

New Aakash device with Ice Cream Sandwich version comes rooted by
default. 

for older device with ``froyo``
===============================
NOTE: we **no longer** follow this method, this is kept here for
historical reasons.

``init.rc`` and ``default.prop``
--------------------------------

The 'chroot' environment exist in the directory called ``linux`` which
is in the directory ``/data/local/`` of the device. The first step is
to make the path ``/data/local/`` writable, for this purpose the
installation script(``install.sh``) makes backup of file
``default.prop`` from the devices to the working directory of host
system and pushes a modified version of ``default.prop`` to ``/`` of
the device. The device needs a reboot for the changes to take effect.

The second step is to copy a tarball ``linux.tar.gz`` to the same
location ``/data/local/`` of the device and untar it. The script also
copies a binary `tar` file which does the work of extracting a
tarball. Once this is done, we have an ``chroot`` environment
ready. The hierarchy of ``/data/local/linux/`` is same as any other
GNU/Linux distribution, but completely inactive with 'no' web-server
and graphical support.

The mounting of file-systems such as ``/proc``, ``/sys`` and
``/dev/pts/`` is done by another bash script ``aakash.sh`` which also
takes care of initiating a webserver every time the device is turned
ON. ``aakash.sh`` also sets an display environment by initiating an
virtual framebuffer environment using ``Xvfb``. ``aakash.sh`` script
is called by Android's ``init.rc`` file at boot time.

- below lines in ``init.rc`` calls ``aakash.sh``

::
   
   service myscript /data/local/aakash.sh
        oneshot


Once all the files and directories are in place, ``install.sh`` script
does the work of cleanup. This will remove all temporary file created
at the time of installation and lock the device back by updating the
original ``default.prop``.
