Particular cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Matlab expression evaluated can be a cell, in this particular use,
all values of cell are considered individually (similarly to a OR). In
Scilab it can not be a cell (Matlab particularity can be replaced by
others "case" or all switch/case statement can be replaced by a
if/then/else statement.).
