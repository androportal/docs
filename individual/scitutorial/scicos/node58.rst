Code Generation
---------------
This menu allows to generate the simulation code associated with a
discrete time Superblock.
The code generation is obtained simply by selecting this menu and then
the desired superblock.
If the superblock satisfies the required conditions, a dialog box pops
up to ask for a block name, a directory where to put the generated
files and for optional libraries requested by the linker.
Given this information the code is generated, compiled and linked with
Scilab. The superblock is automatically replaced by a new block which
implements the generated code. It is then possible to run the modified
diagram.
