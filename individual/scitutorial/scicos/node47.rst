Run
---
Select the Run menu item to start the simulation. If the system has
already been simulated, a dialog box appears where you can choose to
Continue, Restart or End the simulation.
You may interrupt the simulation by clicking on the "stop" button,
change any of the block parameters and continue the simulation with
the new values.
