Save As
-------
Select the Save As menu item to save the block diagram or palette in a
file. A dialog box allows choosing the file which must have a .cos or
.cosf extension. The diagram takes the name of the file (without the
extension).
If extension is ".cosf" an ASCII formatted save is performed instead
of binary save. Formatted save is slower than regular save.
