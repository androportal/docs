Library
~~~~~~~
Linear


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This block should be placed in any block diagram that contains a zero-
crossing block but no continuous system with state. The reason for
that is that it is the ode solver that find zero crossing surfaces.


Default properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


+ always active: yes
+ direct-feedthrough: no
+ zero-crossing: no
+ mode: no
+ number/sizes of inputs: 0 /
+ number/sizes of outputs: 0 /
+ number/sizes of activation inputs: 0 /
+ number/sizes of activation outputs: 0 /
+ continuous-time state: yes
+ discrete-time state: no
+ name of computational function: *cdummy*
