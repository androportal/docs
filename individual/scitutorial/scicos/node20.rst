Save as Palette
---------------
Select the Save as Palette menu item to save the block diagram as a
palette in a file. A dialog box allows choosing the file which must
have a .cos or .cosf extension. The palette takes the name of the file
(without the extension).
If extension is ".cosf" an ASCII formatted save is performed instead
of binary save. It may take a while
SCIHOME/.scilab user file is updated if necessary.
