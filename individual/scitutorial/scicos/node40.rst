Flip
----
To reverse the positions of the (regular) inputs and outputs of a
block placed on its sides, select the Flip menu item first and then
click on the selected block. This does not affect the order, nor the
position of the input and output event ports which are numbered from
left to right.
A connected block cannot be flipped.
