Display mode
------------
Display mode can be 0 or 1. In mode 1, scicos editor uses the pixmap
option of Scilab graphics to create a backing store for the graphics
used for displaying scicos diagrams. By default, Display mode is 0.
Under Windows operating system the backing store is handled in a
different way.
