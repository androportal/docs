Scilab Function
**scicosim** - Scicos (batch) simulation function



Calling Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[state,t] = scicosim(state,tcur,tf,sim,str,tol)




Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~


+ **state** : Scilab tlist containing initial state. Usually generated
  by Scicos Compile. After loading a compiled .cos file, it can be found
  in %cpr.state.
+ **tcur** : starting time of simulation. At the beginning it must be
  zero.
+ **tf** : final simulation time.
+ **sim** : Scilab tlist containing compilation results. Usually
  generated by Scicos Compile. After loading a compiled .cos file, it
  can be found in %cpr.sim.
+ **str** : 'start' , 'run' or 'finish'. Function must be first called
  with 'start', then with 'run' one or more times, and finally with
  'finish'.
+ **tol** : vector [atol,rtol,ttol,deltat,realtimescale,solver,hmax]
  where atol, rtol are respectively the absolute and relative tolerances
  for ode or dae solver, ttol is the precision on event dates (must be
  very small). deltat is maximum integration interval for each call to
  ode solver (sometimes needed to force restaring the call to solver).
  raltimescale is the correspondance between simulation time and real
  time (0 means no slowing down). solver is the choice of solver (0:
  lsodar, 100: daskr). hmax: max step size used by solver. Default:
  [0.0001,1.000E-06,1.000E-10,100001,0,0]
+ **state** : state after simulation
+ **t** : final reached time. Usually tf but not always.




Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

**** Simulator for Scicos compiled diagram. Usually scicosim is called
  by scicos to perform simulation of a diagram. But scicosim may also be
  called outside Scicos. Typical usage in such a case may be: 1- Use
  Scicos to define a block diagram, compile it. 2- Save the compiled
  diagram using Save,SaveAs Scicos menus . 3- In Scilab, load saved file
  using load function. You get variables scicos_ver, scs_m, %cpr scs_m
  is the diagram Scicos main data structure. %cpr is the data structure
  containing (state,sim,cor,corinv) if the diagram had been compiled
  before saved, else %cpr=list(). 4- Extract state, sim out of cpr 5-
  Execute [state,t]=scicosim(state,0,tf,sim,'start',tol) for
  initialisation. 6- Execute
  [state,t]=scicosim(state,0,tf,sim,'run',tol) for simulation from 0 to
  tf. Many successives such calls may be performed changing initial and
  final time. 7- Execute [state,t]=scicosim(state,0,tf,sim,'finish',tol)
  at the very end of the simulation to close files,... For advanced user
  it is possible to "manually" change some parameters or state values.
