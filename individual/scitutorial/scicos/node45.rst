Compile
-------
select the Compile menu item to compile the block diagram. This menu
item need never be used since compilation is performed automatically,
if necessary, before the beginning of every simulation (Run menu
item).
Normally, a new compilation is not needed if only system parameters
and internal states are modified. In some cases however these
modifications are not correctly updated and a manual compilation may
be needed before a Restart or a Continue. Please report if you
encounter such a case.
