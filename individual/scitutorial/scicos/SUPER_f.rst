Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This block opens up a new Scicos window for editing a new block
diagram. This diagram describes the internal functions of the super
block.
Super block inputs and outputs (regular or event) are designated by
special (input or output) blocks.
Regular input blocks must be numbered from 1 to the number of regular
input ports. Regular input ports of the super block are numbered from
the top of the block shape to the bottom. Regular output portss must
be numbered from 1 to the number of regular output ports. Regular
output ports of the super block are numbered from the top of the block
shape to the bottom. Event input blocks must be numbered from 1 to the
number of event input ports. Event input ports of the super block are
numbered from the left of the block shape to the right. Event output
ports must be numbered from 1 to the number of event output ports.
Event output ports of the super block are numbered from the left of
the block shape to the right.
