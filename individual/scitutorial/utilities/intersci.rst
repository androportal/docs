Scilab Tool Last update : April 1993
**intersci** - scilab tool to interface C of Fortran functions with
scilab



Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

All scilab primitive functions are defined in a set of interface
routines. For each function the interfacing code checks first number
of rhs and lhs arguments. Then it get pointers on input arguments in
the Scilab data base and checks their types. After that it calls
procedure associated with Scilab functions, checks returned errors
flags and set the results in the data base.

**intersci** \ is a program which permits to interface automatically
FORTRAN subroutines or C functions to Scilab

With **intersci** , a user can group all his FORTRAN or C code into a
same set, called an interface, and use them in Scilab as Scilab
functions. The interfacing is made by creating a FORTRAN subroutine
which has to be linked to Scilab together with the user code. This
complex FORTRAN subroutine is automatically generated by **intersci**
\ from a description file of the interface.

Refer to intersci documentation for more details.
