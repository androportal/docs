Scilab Function Last update : 20/12/2004
**make_index** - creates a new index file for on-line help



Calling Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make_index()




Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The on-line help reads first the **index.html** file which contains
the list of the chapters. This file comes with Scilab and is in the
directory **SCIDIR/man/<language>** (see ` **man** `_). It is possible
to change this index file while interactively adding new chapters. For
that, modify the ` **%helps** `_ variable and then use the
**make_index** function.
