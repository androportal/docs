Scilab Variable Last update : January 2002
**LANGUAGE** - Variable defining the language



Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The global variable **LANGUAGE** is a string. It defines the language
to use for the on-line help and various menus. At the present time,
the values of **LANGUAGE** can be **"eng"** for English, which is the
default, or **"fr"** for French.

This variable is defined in the startup file **scilab.star** . It can
be changed there.

When launching Scilab, you can also give the value of language as an
argument: **scilab -l <language>** for Unix and **runscilab.exe -l
<language>** for Windows.
