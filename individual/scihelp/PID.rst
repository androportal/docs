Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This block implements a PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential)
controller. It calculates an "error" value Ue as the difference
between a measured process variable Upr and a desired setpoint Ur.



The purpose is to make the process variable Up follow the setpoint
value Ur. The PID controller is widely used in feedback control of
industrial processes.

The PID controller calculation (algorithm) involves three separate
parameters; the Proportional Kp, the Integral Ki and Derivative Kd
values. These terms describe three basic mathematical functions
applied to the error signal Ue. Kp determines the reaction to the
current error, Ki determines the reaction based on the sum of recent
errors and Kd determines the reaction to the rate at which the error
has been changing.

The weighted sum of these three actions is used to adjust the process
via a control element such as the position of a control valve or the
power supply of a heating element. The basic structure of conventional
feedback control systems is shown below:



PID law is a linear combinaison of an input variable Up(t), its time
integral Ui(t) and its first derivative Ud(t). The control law Ucon(t)
has the form:

Example 1
~~~~~~~~~

This example illustrates the usage of PID regulator. It enables you to
fit the output signal Upr(t) to the required signal Ur(t) easily.

In this example the control system is a second-order unity-gain low-
pass filter with damping ratio Î¾=0.5 and cutoff frequency fc= 100 Hz.
Its transfer function H(s) is:



To model this filter we use Continuous transfer function block (CLR)
from Continuous time systems Palette.

The PID parameters Kp, Ki and Kd are set to 100, 0.1 and 0.



The scope displays the waveforms of system error Ue (black), reference
signal Ur (blue) and process signal Upr(red). It shows how initially
the process signal Upr(t) does not follow the reference signal Ur(t).
