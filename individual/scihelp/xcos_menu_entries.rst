File menu
~~~~~~~~~




+ **File:New (Ctrl+N)** Clicking on the *New* menu item open a new
  empty *Xcos* diagram in a new window. With this menu, you can open a
  new diagram or a new palette.
+ **File:Open (Ctrl+O)** Select the *Open* menu item to load an XML (
  *.xcos*) or a binary file ( *.cos*) which contain saved block diagram
  or a palette. The command open a dialog box allows you to choose the
  folder and the file.
+ **File:Save (Ctrl+S)** Select the *Save* menu item to save the
  diagram in a *XML* file. If you select this menu item and you have
  never clicked on the *Save* or *Save As* menu item, a dialog allows
  you to choose a directory and specify a file name without extension.
  The default extension is *.xcos*. The diagram takes the name of the
  file (without the extension).
+ **File:Save As (Ctrl+Shift+S)** Select the *Save As* menu item to
  save the block diagram or palette in a file with a new name. A dialog
  box allows specifying a file name without the extension and a saving
  folder. The default extension is *.xcos*. The diagram takes the name
  of the file (without the extension).
+ **File:Export (Ctrl+E)** This item is used to export a figure of the
  current *Xcos* diagram. The export can be done in the WBMP, GIF, HTML,
  JPEG, JPG, PNG, SVG or VML formats.
+ **File:Recent Files** Via this menu, you have a quick access to the
  recent opened files.
+ **File:Print (Ctrl+P)** Print the current diagram onto a printer.
+ **File:Close (Ctrl+W)** If several diagrams are opened, the *Close*
  action the current diagram. If only one diagram is opened, the *Close*
  action will close *Xcos*. The auxiliary windows as viewport, palettes,
  etc are also closed if necessary.
+ **File:Quit (Ctrl+Q)** The *Quit* action will close *Xcos*. The
  auxiliary windows as viewport, palettes, etc are also closed if
  necessary.




Edit menu
~~~~~~~~~




+ **Edit:Undo (Ctrl+Z)** Select the *Undo* menu item to undo the last
  edit operation.
+ **Edit:Redo (Ctrl+Y)** Select the *Redo* menu item to redo the last
  undo edit operation.
+ **Edit:Cut (Ctrl+X)** *Cut* is used to remove the selected objects
  from the diagram and to copy them in the clipboard. When you cut a
  block all links connected to it are deleted as well.
+ **Edit:Copy (Ctrl+C)** *Copy* is used to place a copy of the
  selected in the clipboard.
+ **Edit:Paste (Ctrl+V)** *Paste* places the content of the clipboard
  in the current diagram.
+ **Edit:Delete (Delete)** To delete blocks or links, select objects
  to be deleted and then the *Delete* menu item. When you delete a block
  all links connected to it are deleted as well.
+ **Edit:Select all (Ctrl+A)** *Select all* the blocks in the current
  diagram.
+ **Edit:Invert selection** Invert the current selection.
+ **Edit:Block Parameters (Ctrl+B)** Open the block configuration
  dialog for the current selected block. The configuration depends of
  the used block (see the block help to obtain more information on its
  configuration).
+ **Edit:Region to superblock** Convert a selection of blocks into a
  superblock.




View menu
~~~~~~~~~




+ **View:Zoom in (Ctrl+Plus)** When you select this menu item the
  diagram is zoomed in by a factor of 10%.
+ **View:Zoom out (Ctrl+Minus)** When you select this menu item the
  diagram is zoomed out by a factor of 10%.
+ **View:Fit diagram to view** When you select this menu item the
  diagram is fit to the size of the current window.
+ **View:Normal 100%** Resize the diagram components at their normal
  displaying dimensions.
+ **View:Palette browser** Open the palette browser.
+ **View:Diagram browser** Displays a window which lists the global
  properties of a diagram and all its objects (blocks and links). It
  presents in a tree form the *scs_m* structure content of the diagram.
+ **View:Viewport** Display the *Viewport* window. This window is a
  complete image of the current diagram. With the *Viewport*, you can
  move the displaying working area onto a part of the diagram. You can
  zoom and unzoom part of a diagram. Above, you have an example of the
  viewport docked in the *Xcos* which is used to zoom on a part of a
  diagram. On the left the editor window presents the zoomed part of the
  diagram.
+ **View:Details** Displays a window by selected block which list
  properties of block. It presents in a tree form the *scicos_block*
  structure content of the blocks.




Simulation menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




+ **Simulation:Setup** In the main *Xcos* window, clicking on the
  *Setup* menu item invokes the dialog box below that allows you to
  change integration (simulation) parameters:

    + **Final integration time**: integration (simulation) ends at this
      time, it always starts from 0
    + **Real time scaling**: forces real time simulation by setting *Xcos*
      simulation in unit of time to 1 second.
    + **Absolute and relative error tolerances**: solver properties.
    + **Time tolerance**: the smallest time interval for which the ode
      solver is used to update continuous states.
    + **Max integration time interval**: the maximum time interval for
      each call to solver.it must be reduced if the error message "Too many
      calls" is encountered
    + **Solver**: select the numerical solver to be used. You have the
      choice between an ordinary differential equations (ODE) solver and an
      algebraic differential equations solver (IDA). If *Xcos* detects that
      your model requires an IDA solver, *Xcos* displays an information box
      on the automatic switching to the IDA solver.
    + **Max step size**: maximum time step taken by the solver. This
      parameter is useful to search localized singularities in a monotonic
      system response. For this type of response, the numerical solver
      increase automatically the step size for decrease the calculation
      time. If you think that your system is in this case, decrease the
      value of this parameter.
    + **Set context**: see explanation below
    + **Default**: this button reset the simulation parameters to their
      factory values.
  For more information on the solver look at the `See Also`_ section.
+ **Execution Trace and Debug** Set *Xcos* in debug mode. This item
  opens the following dialog box in which you can choose the debugging
  mode. For more information, see the command `scicos_debug`_
+ **Simulation:Set Context** When you select this menu item you obtain
  this dialog: You can enter here *Scilab* instructions for defining the
  symbolic *Xcos* parameters used in block definitions or to do whatever
  you want. These instructions will be evaluated each time the diagram
  is loaded. If you change the value of a symbolic *Xcos* parameters in
  the context, all the blocks that contains this symbolic parameter are
  updated when you click on *OK*. By example if you want to set the
  value of gain of several blocks to a value which depends on a single
  value, you can proceed like this :

    #. We have three GAINBLK_f blocks, open the *Set context* dialog and
       writes the symbolic variables:

::

        A = 1.5;
        B = 2*A;
        C = 3*A;


    #. Then, open successively each block parameters dialog and set for
       the gain value the name of required symbolic value, here *A*, *B* and
       *C*.

+ **Simulate:Compile** Select the *Compile* menu item to compile the
  block diagram. This menu item need never be used since compilation is
  performed automatically, if necessary, before the beginning of every
  simulation ( *Run* menu item). Normally, a new compilation is not
  needed if only system parameters and internal states are modified. In
  some cases however these modifications are not correctly updated and a
  manual compilation may be needed before a *Restart* or a *Continue*.
  **Please report to us if you encounter such a case.** `Report bugs and
  wishes about *Scilab*`_
+ **Simulate:Modelica initialize** This menu item opens a specific
  dialog to the *Modelica* compiler where you can see the components of
  your model and also select the solver between the *Kinsol*, *Ida*,
  *Fsolve*, *Optim*, *Nelder Mead* and *Hompack* solvers.
+ **Simulate:Start** Select the *Start* menu item to start the
  simulation. If the system has already been simulated, a dialog box
  appears where you can choose to *Continue*, *Restart* or *End* the
  simulation.
+ **Simulation:Stop** You may interrupt the simulation by clicking on
  the *Stop* menu item or on the toolbar button. You can change any of
  the block parameters and continue the simulation with the new values.




Format menu
~~~~~~~~~~~


+ **Format:Rotate (Ctrl+R)** Rotate allows to turn a block on the left
  with an of 90Â°. Rotation affects all the selected blocks.
+ **Format:Flip (Ctrl+F)** To reverse the positions of the activation
  inputs and outputs set at the top and the bottom of a block, select a
  block and select the *Flip* menu item. This does not affect the order,
  nor the position of the input and output event ports which are
  numbered from left to right. Flipping affects all the selected blocks.
+ **Format:Mirror (Ctrl+M)** To reverse the positions of the (regular)
  inputs and outputs set on the left and the right of a block, select a
  block and select the *Mirror* menu item. This does not affect the
  order, nor the position of the input and output ports which are
  numbered from top to bottom. Mirroring affects all the selected
  blocks.
+ **Format:Show/Hide shadow** This menu allows to select 3D shape for
  selected blocks and associated parameters.
+ **Format:Align Blocks** When you select several blocks, it is
  possible to align them on horizontal axis ( *Top*, *Bottom* and
  *Middle*) or on vertical axis ( *Left*, *Right*, *Center*).
+ **Format: Border Color** This menu allows to change the border color
  of the selected blocks.
+ **Format:Fill Color** This menu allows to change the fill color of
  the selected blocks.
+ **Format:Link Style** This menu allows to change the style of the
  link. First select the link and select the appropriate menu item or
  use the shortcuts ( *H*), *S*, *V*). The following list shows the
  results obtained.

    + Horizontal ( *H*)
    + Straight ( *S*)
    + Vertical ( *V*)

+ **Format: Diagram background** This menu allows to change the
  background color.
+ **Format:Grid** This menu allows to activate / deactivate the grid.
  With the grid, the block and link placement on the working area is
  more easy and you obtain a more readable diagram.




Tools menu
~~~~~~~~~~


+ **Tools:Code generation** This menu allows to generate the
  simulation code associated with a discrete time Super Block. The code
  generation is obtained simply by selecting the Super Block and then
  this menu. If the Super Block satisfies the required conditions, a
  dialog box pops up to ask for a block name, a directory where to put
  the generated files and for optional libraries requested by the
  linker. Given this information the code is generated, compiled and
  linked with Scilab. The Super Block is automatically replaced by a new
  block which implements the generated code. It is then possible to run
  the modified diagram. The code for standalone use is also generated.




Help menu
~~~~~~~~~




+ **Help:Xcos Help (F1)** This menu opens the main help browser (if it
  is not open) on the *Xcos* help chapter.
+ **Help:Block Help** To get help on a *Xcos* block, select the block
  and then click on this menu item.
+ **Help:Xcos Demos** The item allows to open some examples of *Xcos*
  diagram.
+ **Help:About Xcos** *About Xcos* item display the current version of
  *Xcos* in a dialog.
