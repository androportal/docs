dialog to set values of the graphics context. **Obsolete function.**



Calling Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


::

    xsetm()




Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This function as well as the `xset`_ one was strongly linked with the
old graphic mode which is no more available. The current graphic is
much more flexible with respect to parameter setting (see the `set`_
and `get`_ functions as well as the `graphics_entities`_ help page).
It is possible to start a more convenient property editor using
`ged`_.
