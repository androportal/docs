Particular cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Empty matrix and substraction In Matlab, substraction can only be
  made if the operands have the same size unless one is a scalar. For
  exemple, empty matrices can only be substracted to another empty
  matrix or a scalar. Note that when you substract an empty matrix to a
  scalar and inversely, Matlab result is always an empty matrix while in
  Scilab, result is equal to the scalar.
