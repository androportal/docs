SciNotes general preferences



Editor
~~~~~~



SciNotes is the default Scilab code editor. It is now possible to use
an external editor using a system dependent command or a Scilab macro
name.



+ **Use SciNotes**: check this box if you want to use SciNotes in
  using commands such like editor or edit.
+ **External editor**: check this radio button to use an external
  system editor, e.g. it is possible to enter "/usr/bin/gedit".
+ **Scilab command**: check this radio button to use an editor which
  is callable via a Scilab macro. This macro should take the same kind
  of argument as the editor command.
