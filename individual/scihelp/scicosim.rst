scicosim
========

xcos (batch) simulation function



Calling Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


::

    [state,t] = scicosim(state,tcur,tf,sim,str,tol)




Module
~~~~~~


+ `xcos`_




Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Simulator for xcos compiled diagram.

Usually scicosim is called by xcos to perform simulation of a diagram.

But scicosim may also be called outside xcos. Typical usage in such a
case may be :



For advanced user it is possible to "manually" change some parameters
or state values.




::

    [state,t] = scicosim(state,tcur,tf,sim,str,tol)




Arguments
~~~~~~~~~


+ **state :** Scilab tlist containing initial state. Usually generated
  by xcos Compile. After loading a compiled .cos file, it can be found
  in %cpr.state.
+ **tcur :** starting time of simulation. At the beginning it must be
  zero.
+ **tf :** final simulation time.
+ **sim :** Scilab tlist containing compilation results. Usually
  generated by xcos Compile. After loading a compiled .cos file, it can
  be found in %cpr.sim.
+ **str :** 'start' , 'run' or 'finish'. Function must be first called
  with 'start', then with 'run' one or more times, and finally with
  'finish'.
+ **tol :** vector [atol,rtol,ttol,deltat,realtimescale,solver,hmax]
  where atol, rtol are respectively the absolute and relative tolerances
  for ode or dae solver, ttol is the precision on event dates (must be
  very small), deltat is maximum integration interval for each call to
  ode solver (sometimes needed to force restaring the call to solver),
  realtimescale is the correspondance between simulation time and real
  time (0 means no slowing down), solver is the choice of solver (0:
  lsodar, 100: daskr), hmax: max step size used by solver. Default:
  [0.0001,1.000E-06,1.000E-10,100001,0,0]
+ **state :** state after simulation
+ **t:** final reached time. Usually tf but not always.
