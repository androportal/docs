intdec
======

Changes sampling rate of a signal



Calling Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


::

    [y]=intdec(x,lom)




Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

:x input sampled signal
: :lom For a 1D signal this is a scalar which gives the rate change.
  For a 2D signal this is a 2-Vector of sampling rate changes `lom`=(col
  rate change,row rate change)
: :y Output sampled signal
:



Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes the sampling rate of a 1D or 2D signal by the rates in lom
