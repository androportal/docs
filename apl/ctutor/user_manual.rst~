Using Aakash Programming Lab(APL)
=================================

Overview
========

1. Locate and click on Aakash Programming Lab(APL) icon in
   application menu

2. After clicking on APL icon, you will see a screen with four icons
   horizontally placed, naming **C, C++, Python and Scilab**

3. In any of the above four option(*C, C++, Python, Scilab) we have
   these common  components.

    - *Text editor*: is located on the left hand side. One can write
      source code in text editor. If you click on the text editor
      area, a virtual keyboard will appear and one can use it to write
      programs. Click ``back button`` (located at right top corner on
      Android status bar) to close the virtual keyboard.

    - *Console output*: is located at right hand side, this will show
      the output of the program.

    .

    - *Execute button*: is located on left side of text area. It is a
      small icon(looks like gears). After writing code in text
      editor, one can click on ``execute`` button to view output. The
      output will appear in console output screen(it should take
      approximately 2 to 10 seconds, depends upon code and algorithm).

    .
    
    - *Example Programs*: Clicking on the ``option button`` at top
      right corner, next to the ``back button`` will pop up the
      horizontal menubar from the bottom. with ``Example`` Programs
      button at the bottom.

    .
    
    - *Save Code*: The ``Save Code`` option will pop up a dialog box
      which ask's for a file name. You don't have to provide the file
      extension, it will be appended by-default. All codes will be
      saved in ``/mnt/sdcard/APL/`` directory. Within the ``/APL/``
      directory, you can browse through respective language directory
      to view your code or an [image]_ file.

    .

    - Click on the ``Example`` Programs button, it will show list of
      example programs. Click on any example to select. The example
      code will appear on text editor. Then click on the execute
      button to run. Output will appear in Console output. One can
      optionally edit the code in text editor and execute again.

.

4. Scilab has one extra component, i.e *plot* option. This will appear
   at the bottom-left of the page. Check this option if your code has
   any plots involved. Uncheck when not needed. All the examples
   provided in Scilab have graphical output, hence graphical option is
   selected automatically when one choose an example.

.

5. One can switch back to other programming environment by clicking
   ``back button`` which will land you to step 2 (page with 4
   options).

6. To exit APL one has to click ``back button`` twice, this will pop
   up one confirmation dialog box. Click ``Yes`` to exit Aakash
   Programming Lab
