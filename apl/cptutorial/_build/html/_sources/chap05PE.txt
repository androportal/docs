Chapter 5: Programming Exercises
================================
1. Write a program to print the first 100 prime numbers. A prime
number any number that can be divided by itself and by 1. Use **cin**
and **cout**. 2. Write a program to produce the first 100 Fibonacci
numbers. A Fibonacci number is one that is the product of the prior
two generated numbers. The sequence is seeded with the values of 0 and
1, so that the sequence starts off as 0 1 1 2 3 ... Fibonacci numbers
are used in computing hash table locations for file management
systems. Use **cin** and **cout** 3. The factorial of an integer
**n**, written **n!**, is the product of the consecutive integers 1
through **n**. For example, 5 factorial is calculated as 5! = 5 * 4 *
3 * 2 * 1 = 120 Write a program to generate and print a table of the
first 10 factorials. 4. Produce a table showing values of x, the
square of x and the cube of x for values of x from 1 to 50.
