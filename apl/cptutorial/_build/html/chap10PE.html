<h1>Chapter 10: Programming Exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-10-programming-exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>1. Write a class called  **CAccount** which contains two
   private data elements, an integer  **accountNumber**
   and a floating point  **accountBalance**, and three
   member functions:

        1. A constructor that allows the user to set
           initial values for  **accountNumber** and
            **accountBalance** and a default constructor
           that prompts for the input of the values for
           the above data members.

        2. A function called  **inputTransaction**,
           which reads a  character value for
            **transactionType** ('D' for deposit
           and 'W' for withdrawal), and a floating point
           value for  **transactionAmount**, which
           updates  **accountBalance**.

        3. A function called  **printBalance**, which
           prints on the screen the  **accountNumber**
           and  **accountBalance**.

2. Design a class  **CCourse** that will hold the
   courses that are offered at a local college.  The class
   should at least have the following data members:

        year = the calendar year the class is being taught
        term = the term the class is being taught in
               (FALL, WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER)
        courseNumber = the course prefix and number
                       (edp171, chm201, ... )
        sectionNumber = the three character value that
                        identifies what specific section
                        of the course is being taught
        building = what building the course is being
                   taught in
        room = what room the course is being taught in
        beginTime = what time the course starts (the
                    beginning time can vary from one
                    meeting to the next,
                    i.e., The class meets at 1:00PM on
                    Monday and Wednesday, but at 1:30PM on
                    Tuesday and Thursday.)
        endTime = what time the course starts (the ending
                  time can vary from one meeting to the
                  next, i.e., The class ends at 3:00PM on
                  Monday and Wednesday, but at 3:30PM on
                  Tuesday and Thursday.)
        meetingDays = what days of the week the course
                      meets, usually more than once a
                      week.

   Develop all methods needed by the class.  You do not
   have to  write a program to use the class.

3. Design a class  **CDocument** that will hold lines
   that compose the contents of a document.  A document
   can be text that comes from disk file or a list of
   lines that are temporarily being held in memory.  The
   class should have a 'has-a' relationship with a
    **CDblList** class which is a double linked list
   class.  The  **CDocument** class should at least have
   the following capabilities:

        1. A constructor that is passed the name of a disk
           file.  The file will be opened, the contents
           read and each line from the file will be stored
           into an element of  the linked list.

        2. A default constructor that initializes the list
           as  being empty.

        3. A copy constructor that initializes the list
           from another instance of the  **CDocument**.

        4. A group of browse functions for the list, such
           as:

             - insert a new item in the list
             - delete an item from the list
             - move to the beginning of the list
             - move to the end of the list
             - move to the next item in the list
             - move to the previous item in the list
             - are we at the beginning of the list
             - are we at the end of the list
             - return the value from the current item in
               the list

        5. A method that returns a reference to the
           current instance of the  **CDocument** class.

   Develop all methods needed by the class.  You do not
   have to write a program to use the class.

4. Design a class  **CView** that will allow for the
   display of  lines of text.  The class will paginate any
   output, pausing at the end of each screen full shown
   and allowing the input of the following commands:

             - N or n for move to next page
             - P or p for move to previous page
             - Q or q to quit the display and return to
               the menu

   The  **CView** class should at least have the
   following capabilities:

        1. A constructor that is passed the address of a
            **CDocument** class.  The  **CDocument**
           class manages the document that will be viewed.


        2. A default constructor that initializes the
           display device to be blank.

   Develop all methods needed by the class.  You do not
   have to write a program to use the class.</pre>
