===============================

    1. You are to write a program that will calculate your electric bill. You are to input the number of kilo-watt hours (kwh) used in a 31 day billing period.
    
    Electricity costs 6.72 cents per kwh, a state tax of
    8% is added as is a city tax of 3.5%.
    
    Write a program that accepts the number of hours used,
    along with your first name, last name, social security number, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone area code and telephone number.
    
    The program is to print a display with the following
    layout:
    
    
     Electric Bill for,
    
    
     Address:
             ,  
     Phone : ()
    
     Amount of electric bill for days
     at is         :
    
     State Tax() :
    
     City Tax (city tax rate>)   :
    
                                  --------
    
     Total                       :
    
    2. Write a program that will input an integer and output the minimum number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
    needed to make up the input amount. Two sample runs follow
    with user input in  **boldface**.
    
    Enter the amount for which change must be created:  **67
    ** You need to return:
    
     2 quarter(s), 1 dime(s), 1 nickel(s) and 2 penny(ies)
    
    Enter the amount for which change must be created:  **
    45** 
    You need to return:
    
     1 quarter(s), 2 dime(s), 0 nickel(s) and 0 penny(ies)
