    1. Write a small program that will prompt for the input of a value for each of the following types:
    
     %c - Yes or No
     %s - Your Name
     %d - Your Height
     %ld - The Circumference of the Earth
     %f - Your Bank Balance
     %lf - The Distance from the Earth to the Moon
    
    Read the values with  **scanf()** and then print those
    values out on the display using  **printf()**. Then
    rewrite the program using  **cin** and  **cout**.
    
    2. Write a program that will prompt for the input of a
    temperature in Fahrenheit and will display as output
    both the Fahrenheit value and the temperature converted to
    Celsius. Use the formula
    
     Celsius Degrees = (Fahrenheit Degrees - 32) * 5/9
    
    3. Write a program that uses  **scanf()** and  **printf()** statements to prompt for your first name, last name, street, city, state and zip code. After input of the values, then print the values out with the following format:
    
     Name:,
     Street:
     City: State:
     Zip:
    
    Rewrite this program using  **cin** and  **cout**.
