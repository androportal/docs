     1. Write a C++ program that compares two text files and
        prints the lines where they first differ.  The program 
        reads one line each from two files until a differing 
        line is found or one of the files is exhausted, in 
        which case the line read from the other file is the 
        first differing line.  If both files are exhausted 
        simultaneously and no differing line has been found, 
        the two files are identical.  
    
        The program must take into account that two files may 
        be the same in the text, but only the number of spaces 
        or blanks on a line are different.  Therefore, each 
        line must be squeezed to eliminate blanks or spaces 
        before they are compared.  This method will give a true 
        comparison of two files.
